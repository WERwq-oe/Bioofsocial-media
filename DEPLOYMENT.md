# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Guide for AvThR

This guide will walk you through deploying your AvThR application to GitHub Pages for free hosting.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- GitHub account
- Git installed on your computer
- Your AvThR project files (already set up)

## 🔧 Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Initialize Git Repository (if not already done)

```bash
cd C:\Users\om\Documents\AvThR
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: AvThR AI Report & Quiz Generator"
```

### Step 2: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and log in
2. Click the **"+"** button in the top-right corner
3. Select **"New repository"**
4. Name your repository: `AvThR` (or any name you prefer)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
6. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 3: Connect Local Repository to GitHub

Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/AvThR.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click on **Settings** tab (near the top of the page)
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section (in the left sidebar)
4. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"**
5. The page will refresh - you're done with this step!

### Step 5: Automatic Deployment

The GitHub Actions workflow (already included in your project) will:
- Automatically trigger when you push code
- Build and deploy your site
- Make it available at: `https://your-username.github.io/AvThR`

## ⏱️ Deployment Timeline

- **First deployment**: 2-5 minutes after pushing code
- **Subsequent deployments**: 1-3 minutes after each push
- **Propagation**: Additional 1-2 minutes for global availability

## 🔍 Monitoring Deployment

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click the **Actions** tab
3. You'll see the deployment workflow running
4. Click on a workflow run to see detailed logs

## 🌐 Your Live Application

Once deployed, your application will be available at:
```
https://your-username.github.io/AvThR
```

## 🔄 Making Updates

To update your live application:

```bash
# Make your changes to files
# Then commit and push:
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
git push
```

The site will automatically update within a few minutes!

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### GitHub Actions Workflow
The `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file handles:
- ✅ Automatic deployment on push to main branch
- ✅ Static file optimization
- ✅ GitHub Pages configuration
- ✅ HTTPS certificate setup

### API Integration
The application uses:
- ✅ Google Gemini 2.0 Flash model
- ✅ Client-side API calls (no backend required)
- ✅ HTTPS for secure API communication
- ✅ Direct API key integration (embedded in code)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **404 Error after deployment**
   - Wait 5-10 minutes for full propagation
   - Check that `index.html` exists in root directory
   - Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings

2. **API not working**
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Verify API key is correctly embedded in `script.js`
   - Test API key with Google AI Studio

3. **Workflow fails**
   - Check Actions tab for error messages
   - Ensure all files are committed and pushed
   - Verify repository has GitHub Pages enabled

### Quick Fixes:

```bash
# Force push if needed (use carefully)
git push --force

# Check repository status
git status

# View commit history
git log --oneline
```

## 🎯 Testing Your Deployment

1. **Visit your live URL**: `https://your-username.github.io/AvThR`
2. **Test Report Generation**:
   - Enter a topic like "Climate Change"
   - Generate a report
   - Download the HTML file
3. **Test Quiz Generation**:
   - Enter a topic like "World History"
   - Generate a quiz
   - Take the interactive quiz

## 🔒 Security Notes

- ✅ API key is embedded in client-side code (acceptable for this use case)
- ✅ GitHub Pages serves over HTTPS by default
- ✅ No sensitive server-side data
- ✅ CORS-compliant API calls

## 📈 Performance Optimization

Your GitHub Pages deployment includes:
- ✅ Global CDN delivery
- ✅ Automatic GZIP compression
- ✅ HTTP/2 support
- ✅ Caching headers
- ✅ Mobile optimization
